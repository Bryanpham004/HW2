# Homework 2

This homework involves implementing the Dequeue data structure as well as some practice problems involving Graphs, DFS, and Stacks. 

The format will be similar to previous Homeworks.. There are 2 parts: the first part is in the `DataStructures` folder, and the second part is in `Practice`. 

For this assignment and future assignments you will be required to write your own tests to develop good test writing habits. Please reference HW 0 and HW 1 for example tests.
There still will be an autograder so try to make your tests as robust as possible!

Once your personal repository is generated, you can do your work in it! As a reminder of how to use Git:
1. Clone your repository to your computer using `git clone https://github.com/atdp-dse/hw1-YOURUSERNAMEHERE` (replace with your username).
2. To save your work to GitHub, remember the sequence `git add .`, `git commit -m"YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"`, and `git push`. **Commit small changes often!** 
3. Once you're ready to submit, go to Gradescope where there should be an option to submit with GitHub. After connecting your GitHub account, your homework repository should show up at the top. You can simply select it and Gradescope will automatically run the tests on your code.
